  The Prototype Property
  * Fortunately, every function in JavaScript has something called a prototype property.
    Which is empty by default. We can think of a function's prototype as an object blueprint or paradigm.
    When we add methods and properties to the prototype, they are accessible to all instances of that function.

/**
 * Classes
 * JavaScript classes, introduced in ECMAScript 6, are essentially syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing

   This syntax is a means of more simply and clearly creating objects and deal with inheritance.

   Class Declarations
 * One way to define a class is using a class declaration. 
   To declare a class, we use the class keyword and follow it with the class' name. 
   Ideally, we always write class names in TitleCase.

/**
 * The Constructor Method
 * The constructor method is a special method we use to create and initialize objects of a class.
   A class can only have one special method with the name constructor, 
   and attempting to write a class containing more than one constructor method will throw a SyntaxError.
   To implement inheritance, we can use the super keyword in a constructor to call a parent class constructor.

/**
 * Static Methods
 * Static methods are methods relevant to all instances of a class â€” not just any one instance. 
 * These methods receive information from their arguments and not a class instance, 
 * which allows us to invoke a class' static methods without creating an instance of the class. 
 * In fact, we actually can't call a static method on an instantiated class object (attempting to do so throws a TypeError).
 * We define a class' static methods using the static keyword.
 * We typically use these methods to create utility functions for applications, as they can't be called on class objects.
